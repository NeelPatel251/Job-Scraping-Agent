Function of LLM2 (How LLM2 will work)

LLM2 will get 1st job url : - Extract elements using await navigator.get_page_elements() and find Easy Apply and click it using calling tool, which is done by this code

Now after clicking we will call new LLM
    - new LLM should extract buttons and form using new technique , new LLM will not use get_page_elements function
    - Basically one function will be there which can do this and output of this function will be input of new LLM
    - after this, new LLM will fill form using tool or anything else (I dont know), if LLM will call tool please give function of that tool because i dont have this type of function in my tools.py
        - Form will contain Basic Questions like Phone Number, Upload your Resume, How much salary do you expect etc
        - If form is to Upload Resume, then Find Upload Resume Button , click it using tool and upload it (click tool is ther but i dont have any other tool to upload)
    - after filling form, Find Button like Next/Review/Submit Application button
    - If Next button is there, then press it and you will find another form, just repeat the process (It is Red Signal means there is another form)
    - If Review button is there, then press it (It is like Yellow signal means there is no form and you will get Submit Application button after this)
    - If Submit Application button is there, press it and job application is done (Green Signal)

    Remember : there is no order like "Next - Review - Submit" Button

    return to LLM2

    LLM2 will provide next job url and same process
